Notes:
- Haven't used too much of Razor in the past so apologies if I've made eye-burning mistakes
- Functionality-wise, all tasks are completed
- NewsApi seems to be limited to 3 posts at a time, so I couldn't use 5

Additional features and work:
- Vaguely responsive, making use of Bootstrap's columns
- For accessibility, aria-labels were provided and using the Wave browser extension checked for issues such as low colour contrast and ensured semantic HTML was used to help people with screen readers
- BDOBook.App was renamed to BDOBook.Application as my Macbook threw its toys out of the pram thinking the project folder was an application
- It has been ages since I last used SCSS but I used a BEM-ish approach
- Having had it on my mind recently after going through a pen test for Uppr, added middleware for security headers.
  Using ngrok I tested the application on https://securityheaders.com/ and got A+ (after some fumbling)

Further improvements:
- Additional tests could be added, e.g. to Index.cshtml.cs and Profile.cshtml.cs
- Further research into Razor would be needed to allow parts of the page to load independently;
  e.g. show a loading state while retrieving headlines to allow the page to be rendered a little faster (similar to React's Suspense feature)
- Expand the architecture to separate out the frontend from the backend logic e.g. WebUI, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, I didn't do that here as it's a small project
- More work on accessibility e.g:
    - links in navbar for home page are adjacent
    - Skip to main to assist keyboard users
